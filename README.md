# Fibonacci Generator Project

## Project Overview
The Fibonacci Generator project is a Python-based application designed to generate Fibonacci sequences. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly way to generate Fibonacci sequences up to a specified number of terms or within a certain range.

## Features
- Generate Fibonacci sequences up to a specified number of terms.
- Generate Fibonacci sequences within a specified numerical range.
- Command-line interface for easy interaction.
- Input validation to ensure correct and meaningful user inputs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x


## Usage
### Running the Fibonacci Generator
To run the Fibonacci generator, execute the Python script `fibonacci_generator.py` using Python from the command line.



### Command-Line Options
- `--terms`: Specify the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.
- `--range`: Specify the maximum value in the Fibonacci sequence.


## Implementation Details
### Main Script: `fibonacci_generator.py`
This script contains the main logic for generating the Fibonacci sequence. It includes functions for:
- Generating a sequence based on the number of terms.
- Generating a sequence within a specified range.
- Parsing command-line arguments.

### Functions
- `generate_fibonacci_terms(n)`: Generates the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
- `generate_fibonacci_range(max_value)`: Generates Fibonacci numbers up to `max_value`.
- `main()`: Parses command-line arguments and invokes the appropriate function based on user input.

### Example Function: `generate_fibonacci_terms`
```python
def generate_fibonacci_terms(n):
    sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    return sequence[:n]
```
